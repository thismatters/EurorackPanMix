# PanMix

This eurorack module is based upon the [yusynth design](https://yusynth.net/Modular/EN/MIXOUT/index.html), which I learned about from [TOIL's video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wUGyGTA9OOM) about their implementation of the circuit (among others).

This project uses [this library of footprints](https://github.com/thismatters/EurorackKiCAD) in addition to the default libraries.
